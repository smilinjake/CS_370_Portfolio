# CS_370_Portfolio
Brief Description: _Portfolio containing Final Project from SNHU CS 370 Current/Emerging Trends in Computer Science_


__Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?__
* This is the final project for SNHU CS 370. The goal for this project was to train an intelligent agent to find the treasure in a maze using the Q-Learning reinforcement learning algorithm. I was given all of the files for the majority of the project, my job was to train the intelligent agent by writing the algorithm. The Q-learnign algorithm that I created is located in the Ward_JacobProjectTwo.ipynb file where it says START HERE. 

__What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?__
* Computer scientists design and develop software, algorithms, and systems that solve real-world problems. Their work powers everything from healthcare and education to communication and entertainment. It matters because the innovations of computer scientists drive technological progress and improve the quality of life for people across the globe.

__How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?__
* I approach problems methodically by breaking them into smaller, manageable parts. I analyze requirements, design potential solutions, test prototypes, and refine based on feedback or data. This systematic and logical approach ensures efficiency, reliability, and scalability in the final solution. -And I religiously use debuggers, print statements, and logger messages when things get hairy. 

__What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?__
* My ethical responsibilities include protecting user privacy, ensuring data security, and creating software that is both accessible and fair. I also need to be honest about system limitations and avoid harmful or biased design choices. Maintaining these standards builds trust and promotes responsible innovation.
